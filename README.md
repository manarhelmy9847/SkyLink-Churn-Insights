##  Business Case

SkyLink was facing a significant **customer churn problem**, affecting recurring revenue and reducing customer lifetime value.  
The company needed to identify:
- **Who is churning**
- **Why they are leaving**
- **What actions can reduce churn**

This analysis was created to **empower marketing and customer success teams** with insights that support smarter, proactive retention initiatives.

##  Analytical Approach

Using **customer-level transactional and demographic data**, I built a Power BI dashboard with the following components:
- Contract types (monthly, yearly, group plans)
- Usage behavior (international charges, data overage)
- Service experience (customer support calls)
- Demographics (age group, region, etc.)

Techniques Used:
- **Segmentation** to group churn-prone customers  
- **DAX calculations** for churn rate, customer lifetime value, and risk levels  
- **Visual analytics** for pattern discovery, filtering, and dashboard storytelling

---

##  Key Insights

-  **Month-to-month contracts** and lack of international/unlimited plans showed **high churn probability**
-  **More customer service calls** correlated strongly with dissatisfaction and churn
-  **Younger customers (<30)** and those with additional charges had above-average churn rates
-  **Group and long-term contracts** had the lowest churn, proving loyalty programs are effective
