# 📉 SkyLink Churn Analysis – Power BI Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes customer churn behavior for **SkyLink**, a telecommunications provider experiencing high customer turnover. Using an interactive Power BI dashboard, the project uncovers churn drivers, highlights high-risk segments, and supports data-driven retention strategies.

## 🎯 Business Case

SkyLink was facing a significant **customer churn problem**, affecting recurring revenue and reducing customer lifetime value.  
The company needed to identify:
- **Who is churning**
- **Why they are leaving**
- **What actions can reduce churn**

This analysis was created to **empower marketing and customer success teams** with insights that support smarter, proactive retention initiatives.

## 🧠 Analytical Approach

Using **customer-level transactional and demographic data**, I built a Power BI dashboard with the following components:
- Contract types (monthly, yearly, group plans)
- Usage behavior (international charges, data overage)
- Service experience (customer support calls)
- Demographics (age group, region, etc.)

### Techniques Used:
- **Segmentation** to group churn-prone customers  
- **DAX calculations** for churn rate, customer lifetime value, and risk levels  
- **Visual analytics** for pattern discovery, filtering, and dashboard storytelling

## 🔍 Key Insights

- 📅 **Month-to-month contracts** and lack of international/unlimited plans showed **high churn probability**
- ☎️ **More customer service calls** correlated strongly with dissatisfaction and churn
- 👥 **Younger customers (<30)** and those with additional charges had above-average churn rates
- 🤝 **Group and long-term contracts** had the lowest churn, proving loyalty programs are effective

## 📈 Business Impact

The dashboard provided strategic visibility into churn patterns and supported:
- Tailored promotions (e.g., international/data bundles for high-risk users)
- Loyalty incentives for at-risk demographics
- Targeted outreach to customers with poor service experiences

SkyLink implemented initiatives based on these insights, **projected to reduce churn by 18%**, improving retention and revenue.
